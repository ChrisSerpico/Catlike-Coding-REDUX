# Catlike-Coding-REDUX

3 years ago (which is 2015!!!) I decided to go through the wonderful tutorials at https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/. It was fun but stuff got in the way and I never got very far. With the free time I have ~~from being unemployed~~, I'm trying to do it again. 

Each tutorial is a separate Unity Project held in its own folder. 

NOTE: Because each of these projects follow along a publically available (and very good) tutorial, comments in the code are sparse. The only comments are either ones directly from the tutorial or ones in places where I have chosen to deviate from the tutorial.
